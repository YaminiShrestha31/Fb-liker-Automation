# Fb-liker-Automation


I wrote an Automation script in JavaScript with puppeteer which is basically an Facebook Auto_Liker.
It takes your credentials like your Facebook username and password and the username of the person/page whose post's you want to like.
It first open's the Facebook with your credentials and than goes to the posts of that user/page,
and likes n number of posts.
